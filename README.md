The data is presented in a couple of formats to suit different individual's needs or computational limitations. I have included files containing 5 years of stock data (in the allstocks5yr.csv and corresponding folder).

The folder individualstocks5yr contains files of data for individual stocks, labelled by their stock ticker name. The allstocks5yr.csv contains the same data. 

All the files have the following columns:
Date - in format: yy-mm-dd

Open - price of the stock at market open (this is NYSE data so all in USD)

High - Highest price reached in the day

Low Close - Lowest price reached in the day

Volume - Number of shares traded

Name - the stock's ticker name
